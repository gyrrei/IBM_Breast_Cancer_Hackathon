    "# AI@University - Preparation Material\n",
    "This preparation material aims to give you an intuition on the activities and skills needed during the upcoming workshop at your university. The center piece of this workshop will be a compact hacking competition, in which you solve a given customer case in small groups, using Machine Learning. This notebook illustrates the general approach to solving such a case study, and it is recommended to follow a similar structure during the hacking competition of the workshop.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prerequisites\n",
    "Familiarity with the **Python 3** programming language, related libraries, such as **pandas**, **numpy** or **scikit-learn**, as well as **Jupyter Notebooks** are required. So before the workshop, please make sure that you have installed Python 3 and Juypter Notebooks, preferrably using the [Anaconda distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/download/#macos), as it already contains a set of useful Data Science libraries.\n",

    "# Case Study: Thomas J. Watson Hospital - Oncology Department\n",
    "You have been hired as a consulting team of Data Scientists by the oncology department of the **Thomas J. \n",
    "Watson Hospital** in **Berlin**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The oncology department is highly recognized and attracts patients from all over the world\n",
    "due to its exceptional and effective treatment methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "To maintain its excellent reputation and pioneer in the area of cancer treatment, the Thomas J. Watson hospital\n",
    "setup a new Technology Council with the goal to investigate future-oriented technologies to support its oncologists. Concretely, the Council agreed to target the identification of breast cancer in its early stages, which enables treating the disease more effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "You have been engaged by the Technology Counsil to find a solution that assists the oncologists in classifying whether a breast tumor is \n",
    "**malignant** or **benign**.\n",
    "\n",
    "You should present your results to the hospital board coming Friday. Keep in mind to present your findings in a way\n",
    "that both business and technical stakeholders feel addressed.\n",

    "### Data\n",
    "This breast cancer databases was obtained from the University of Wisconsin Hospitals, Madison from Dr. William H. Wolberg:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Wisconsin Breast Cancer Database** (January 8, 1991), O. L. Mangasarian and W. H. Wolberg: \"Cancer diagnosis via linear programming\", SIAM News, Volume 23, Number 5, September 1990, pp 1 & 18, link: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/breast-cancer-wisconsin/\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Dictionary\n",
    "All attributes, except the target value (`class`) are numeric and range from `1` to `10`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Attribute|Description\n",
    "---|---\n",
    "sample_code_number|ID number of sample\n",
    "clump_thickness|In the Clump thickness benign cells tend to be grouped in monolayers, while cancerous cells are often grouped in multilayer.\n",
    "uniformity_of_cell_size|While in the Uniformity of cell size/shape the cancer cells tend to vary in size and shape. That is why these parameters are valuable in determining whether the cells are cancerous or not. \n",
    "uniformity_of_cell_shape|see above\n",
    "marginal_adhesion|In the case of Marginal adhesion the normal cells tend to stick together, where cancer cells tend to lose this ability. So loss of adhesion is a sign of malignancy.\n",
    "single_epithelial_cell_size|In the Single epithelial cell size the size is related to the uniformity mentioned above. Epithelial cells that are significantly enlarged may be a malignant cell.\n",
    "bare_nuclei|The Bare nuclei is a term used for nuclei that is not surrounded by cytoplasm (the rest of the cell). Those are typically seen in benign tumors. \n",
    "bland_chromatin|The Bland Chromatin describes a uniform \"texture\" of the nucleus seen in benign cells. In cancer cells the chromatin tends to be coarser. \n",
    "normal_nucleoli|The Normal nucleoli are small structures seen in the nucleus. In normal cells the nucleolus is usually very small if visible. In cancer cells the nucleoli become more prominent, and sometimes there are more of them. \n",
    "mitoses|Finally, Mitoses is nuclear division plus cytokines and produce two identical daughter cells during prophase. It is the process in which the cell divides and replicates. Pathologists can determine the grade of cancer by counting the number of mitoses\n",
    "class|Label: Benign=2, Malignant=4\n",
    "\n",
    "### Medical Background\n",
    "Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women and one of the major causes of death worldwide.\n",
    "Every year approximately 124 out of 100,000 women are diagnosed with breast cancer, and the estimation is that 23 out of the 124 women will die of this disease. When  detected  in  its  early  stages,  there  is  a  30%  chance that  the cancer can be treated effectively, but the late detection of advanced-stage tumors makes the treatment more difficult."
