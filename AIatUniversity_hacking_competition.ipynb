    "# AI@University - Hacking Competition\n",
    "\n",
    "For this hacking competition you have **2 hours** to solve the **Maternity Ward** case study in teams of **4-5 students**. Be aware, that during that time you have to implement your **technical solution** as well as prepare a short **5 minute presentation** of your results. It is recommended to split the work amongst your team members accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before the workshop, please make sure that you have installed Python 3 and the Juypter Notebook environment, preferrably using the [Anaconda distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/download/#macos), as it contains already a set of useful Data Science libraries such as pandas, numpy and scikit-learn.\n",

    "# Case Study: Thomas J. Watson Hospital - Maternity Ward\n",
    "After delivering a successful project for the oncology department of the **Thomas J. Watson Hospital** in **Berlin**, you have been hired as a consulting team of Data Scientists by the maternity ward to deliver another consulting project.\n",
    "\n",
    "The hospital is facing some challenges in treating the increasing number of pregnant women in Berlin, as the hospital's\n",
    "staff is either decreasing (paramedical staff) or only slightly increasing (physicians). The hospital's board of directors fears that the increasing birthrate and lackof personnel might impact the time and treatment their employees have for the young families. Their patients health is their highest priority.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the Thomas J. Watson hospital is looking for ways to support its personnel in ensuring that the best \n",
    "possible care is given to the soon-to-be mothers and their children.\n",
    "\n",
    "You have been hired to find a solution that assists the physicians and paramedics in determining the health condition\n",
    "of the fetus and its mother. To accomplish your goal, you have been provided with cardiotocography data that enables\n",
    "you to predict whether the fetal health condition is **normal** or **pathologic** (Hint: the dataset might contain more classes on the health condition, which the hospital is not interested in).\n",
    "\n",
    "You should present your results to the hospital board coming Friday. Keep in mind to present your findings in a way\n",
    "that both business and technical stakeholders feel addressed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Dictionary\n",
    "The dataset consists of measurements of fetal heart rate (FHR) and uterine contraction (UC) features on cardiotocograms classified by expert obstetricians.\n",
    "\n",
    "Attribute|Description\n",
    "---|---\n",
    "LB|FHR baseline (beats per minute)\n",
    "AC|number of accelerations per second\n",
    "FM|Number of fetal movements per second\n",
    "UC|Number of uterine contractions per second\n",
    "ASTV|Percentage of time with abnormal short term variability\n",
    "mSTV|Mean value of short term variability \n",
    "ALTV|Percentage of time with abnormal long term variability \n",
    "mLTV|Mean value of long term variability\n",
    "DL|Number of light decelerations per second\n",

    "### Medical Background\n",
    "To ensure fetal and maternal health during pregnancy, **cardiotocography**, the measurement of **fetal heart rate** \n",
    "(FHR) and **uterine contractions** (UC), is used to identify pathologic health conditions early on. Currently, \n",
    "FHR and UC data is analyzed manually by a physician or paramedic, therefore leaving room for errors. FHR and UC are \n",
    "strong indicators for certain critical health conditions, like a lack of oxygen, prematurity or growth restrictions, \n",
    "that can lead to impairment and even death of the fetus. Cardiotocography is used both during pregnancy and during \n",
    "delivery of the child.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Evaluation\n",
    "### Technical Solution (50%)\n",
    "Your technical solution will be evaluated based on the degree of **accuracy** of your predictions on the hold-out validation set.\n",
    "\n",
    "![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cdpi%7B300%7D%20%5Ctiny%20%5Ctext%7Baccuracy%7D%28y%2C%20%5Chat%7By%7D%29%20%3D%20%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7Bn%7D%20%5Csum_%7Bi%3D1%7D%5E%7Bn%7D%201%28%5Chat%7By%7D_i%20%3D%20y_i%29)\n",

    "Please store your predictions on the validation data as a comma-separated file, and name that file after your team (`YOUR_TEAM_NAME.csv`).\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a CSV-File from an array of predictions (`y_pred`), you can use the following `pandas` function:\n",
